# Solar System Simulation

A physics-based simulation of the inner solar system, coded in Python using Matplotlib and NumPy. This animation models the orbits of planets (and the Moon) based on gravitational interactions and real astronomical data.

## Features
- Simulates gravitational interactions between celestial bodies
- Uses real mass, velocity, and distance values
- Includes Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Moon, Mars, and Jupiter
- Animated with Matplotlib's FuncAnimation

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Output
Generates a high-quality MP4 animation of planetary motion.
