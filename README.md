# Solar System Simulation

This is a physics-based simulation of the inner solar system coded in Python using Matplotlib and NumPy. It calculates and animates the orbits of the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Moon, Mars, and Jupiter using Newtonian gravitational physics.

## Features
- Realistic planetary motion based on mass, velocity, and distance
- Animated orbits using Matplotlibâ€™s `FuncAnimation`
- Includes major planets plus Earth's Moon
- Color-coded trails for better visual clarity

## Customization
You can easily modify the code to:
- Change the simulation **speed** (adjust the `dt` variable)
- Add or remove planets
- Change trail length, colors, or animation duration

All logic is in pure Python and can be extended with other celestial bodies or visual enhancements.
